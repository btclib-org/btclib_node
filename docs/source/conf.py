# every build fetches every mapped inventory, rather than reading back
# the copy sphinx writes beside the doctrees and reuses until that copy
# expires. The copy sits under docs/build, which .gitignore covers, so
# neither a diff nor git status says which of them a build resolved
# against, and
# the same commit then answers green in a worktree building for the first
# time and red in one re-reading a page against a copy taken days
# earlier -- a build re-reading nothing resolves nothing and answers
# green whatever its copy holds, which is why the red comes and goes.
# btclib publishes
# this inventory from its own main, so a name added there since a copy
# was taken resolves for docs.yml's fresh checkout and not for that
# worktree. The other direction is the worse one -- a name btclib has
# removed still resolves off the copy, so a reference the gate exists to
# refuse passes here and fails on docs.yml. -E is not the way out: it
# discards the environment and reads the copy back.
#
# What it costs is a fetch of each inventory on every build, which is
# what docs.yml and .readthedocs.yaml already do, their checkouts
# carrying no copy to read; and a build with no route to a mapped host
# fails under -W where one reading the copy would have passed.
#
# Not -d, putting the doctrees outside the tree: that relocates the copy
# rather than expiring it, and reaches only the command CONTRIBUTING.md
# documents, leaving those two files building against whatever their own
# doctree directory holds. Not a vendored inventory either, which fixes
# the reference set at the commit that added it and leaves the build
# unable to say whether btclib still publishes the name
intersphinx_cache_limit = 0

# What the mapping above cannot answer for, and each entry below carries
# its own reason rather than a nitpick_ignore_regex that would give the
# check up entirely:
#
# - a name a signature carries, or carries inside another name's own
#   subscript, only because ruff's own "TC" family (pyproject.toml's own
#   comment beside it) moves a typing-only import under
#   `if TYPE_CHECKING:` on this tree's >=3.14 target -- deliberately: "TC"
#   is selected because the import costs nothing at runtime there, PEP
#   649's lazy annotation evaluation being native to that version.
#   Autodoc reads a signature's annotation by evaluating it and reading
#   the resulting class's qualified name back off it; that evaluation
#   fails for a module that only imports the name under TYPE_CHECKING,
#   so the annotation renders under the bare name the source spells it
#   with instead, which no inventory -- btclib's or python's -- carries
#   an unqualified entry for. Tx and TxOut (mempool.py's own get_tx and
#   add_tx, among others), Block (utxo_index.py's and filter_index.py's
#   own add_block), NetworkAddressV2 and Payload (p2p/connection.py,
#   p2p/manager.py), Path (p2p/address.py, chainstate/__init__.py,
#   log.py) and ScriptFlag/ScriptFlags (interpreter.py's own get_flags
#   and f) are
#   this tree's own public API doing exactly what "TC"'s own reason asks
#   of it. p2p/manager.py's own Tx is besides imported under the alias
#   BtclibTx, which resolves to nothing under that name for the same
#   reason even once the alias itself is granted an import.
#   block_index.py's own add_headers carries BlockHeader unconditionally,
#   but nested inside `Iterable[BlockHeader]`, and Iterable is what that
#   file imports under TYPE_CHECKING: one guarded name inside a
#   subscript is enough to keep autodoc from resolving the whole
#   annotation, BlockHeader included. __annotationlib_name_1__ is the
#   same defect once more, surfacing as Python 3.14's own placeholder
#   for a name a *compound* annotation could not resolve, rather than as
#   that name itself. __annotationlib_name_2__ is the same placeholder a
#   second time, over a different compound annotation: main.py's own
#   parent_lookup returns `Callable[[BlockHeader], BlockHeader]`, and
#   block_db/__init__.py's own BlockDB.prune_up_to takes a
#   `hash_at_height: Callable[[int], bytes]` -- Callable itself is what
#   each file imports under TYPE_CHECKING, so the whole subscript is
#   unresolved regardless of BlockHeader already being granted its own
#   entry above
# - asyncio.AbstractEventLoop, spelled that way everywhere this tree
#   uses it (p2p/manager.py, rpc/manager.py, rpc/connection.py):
#   autodoc reads the qualified name back off the class itself once
#   resolved, and the class's own `__module__` is asyncio's private
#   implementation module, not the public one docs.python.org publishes
#   an inventory entry under
# - a name this tree documents nowhere. block_db/__init__.py's own
#   Coin.parse carries BinaryData, btclib's own alias.py type alias,
#   undocumented there, so `:members:` renders no page for a signature
#   naming it to link to

# a visibly broken link, it is an anchor to an id the page does not have

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.
html_theme = "furo"

# no html_static_path: this project overrides no stylesheet and ships no
# image, so the "_static" the sphinx template declares was a directory that
# has never existed, and sphinx warns about it on every build. That warning
# was harmless while nothing read it and is a failure now that
# .readthedocs.yaml builds with -W. Re-add the setting with the directory,
# not before it


# -- Links out of the included root markdown files ----------------------------

# Some pages of the toctree are this repository's root markdown files --
# README, CONTRIBUTING, REVIEWING and CHANGELOG -- each pulled into a
# *_link.md shim by a myst {include}. The shims are what the code below
# reads, so adding one needs no edit here. Those files are written for the
# two places that read them unrendered -- the GitHub file view -- so
# "./CONTRIBUTING.md" is the correct spelling there and the one links.yml
# checks, resolving it as a path relative to the file. Sphinx sees them
# lifted out of the tree that makes it correct, and myst resolves not one
# of those links.
#
# What it emits instead is the reason this needs code rather than a
# warning filter: a target myst cannot resolve becomes an anchor on the
# page it is already on, href="#./REVIEWING.md", an id nothing has. The
# build succeeds, -W sees nothing, and lychee reads the sources, where the
# path is right.
#
# The transform below answers each link from the repository rather than
# from a table that would have to be kept in step with this directory: a
# path a *_link.md shim includes becomes a reference to that page, any
# other path that exists in the tree becomes a link to the file on GitHub,
# and a path that exists nowhere is left to myst -- which reports it, and
# -W then fails, now that suppress_warnings no longer hides the subtype.
#
# Not the {include} directive's :relative-docs: option, which is what it
# looks like the job of. It rewrites destinations that begin with the
# prefix it is given, so "docs/source/" leaves "./REVIEWING.md" untouched;
# and giving it "./" is worse than doing nothing, measured on the sibling
# this pattern is read from (bitcoin-core-rpc) -- the destination becomes
# "../../REVIEWING.md", a path outside srcdir that is no document, sphinx
# reads it as a download, finds nothing to copy, and renders the link text
# with no link at all.
#
# Not copying the root files into this directory at build time either.
# README.md links to LICENSE, which is not part of the documentation --
# no shim includes it, which is what decides it -- so copies leave that
# link dead however many are made; and the copies are generated files in
# a source tree, which is a second definition of files that already
# exist.

# a shim is one myst include fence, and everything after the directive
# name on that line is the directive's argument: the path of the file the
# shim renders, spaces included. Options are the lines under it, never
# this one, so the path ends where the line does
