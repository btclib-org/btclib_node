"""Who gets asked for what, and who gets told.

The functional download test drives one node against one peer with
every block to fetch, which is the path where a single queue and a
single answer are indistinguishable from the right ones. What is left
is the arithmetic between peers: who is told about a transaction, who is
asked for it, which peer a block is fetched from, and when a peer that
has stopped sending blocks is let go.
