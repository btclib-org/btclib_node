    """`stop`, called off the loop's thread, does not crash a live reader.

    btclib-org/btclib-node#518: `self.client.close()` used to run
    directly on whichever thread called `stop`, and `stop`'s own comment
    names callers on both -- `handle_p2p`, `handle_p2p_handshake` and
    every callback that drops a peer for cause, on `Node`'s thread;
    `_prune_stale_connections` through `remove_connection`, on
    `P2pManager`'s, which is the loop's own. The race is therefore the
    ordering rather than the thread, and both halves of it are covered:
    this test calls `stop` from off the loop, the one after it from
    the loop's own thread. Closing the fd, while `run`'s own `sock_recv` still
    had a reader registered for it, raced `BaseSelectorEventLoop`'s
    bookkeeping: `_sock_read_done`'s later `remove_reader` found a writer
    also registered -- `Connection._send`'s own `sock_sendall`, for a
    peer not draining its send queue -- and took `_selector.modify`
    rather than `unregister`, and `modify` re-registers a fd that
    `KqueueSelector.unregister` alone would have tolerated closed.
    Reproduced here with a real second thread running the loop, the
    shape `P2pManager` itself runs in, and `stop` called from the thread
    running the test -- the caller not the loop's own. No custom exception
    handler is installed on the loop: the raise this guards against is
    from inside an asyncio callback, which the loop's own default
    handler logs rather than propagates, so `caplog` on that logger's
    own `ERROR` is what would have caught it, not an assertion on a
    value this test would otherwise have to fabricate a branch to reach.
