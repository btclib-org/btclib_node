) -> None:
    """`_accept_loop`'s `OSError` arm logs and retries the accept.

    `accept()` can fail outright -- `ECONNABORTED` being the ordinary
    way, a peer resetting the connection between the kernel reporting
    it readable and the accept reaching it -- and this is what keeps
    that from ending the task outright: the queue `server` awaits is
    left untouched, and a fresh `sock_accept` is tried again rather than
    this coroutine returning.

    `sock_accept` itself is monkeypatched to fail rather than handed a
    socket engineered to make the real one fail: a duck-typed stand-in
    with a `fileno` of -1, this test's own shape before #430's Windows
    run, reaches a selector loop's `sock.accept()` call harmlessly but
    reaches Windows' Proactor at the raw `AcceptEx` level, on the real
    fd it reads off that -1 rather than through any Python-level
    `.accept()` call -- which is what crashed the worker process outright
    rather than raising, on that platform only. What this test is for is
    `_accept_loop`'s own retry-and-log arm, not the kernel's accept
    machinery underneath `sock_accept`, so a fake replacing `sock_accept`
    itself is the narrower fake and is what stays clear of it.

    The failure below is synchronous, so `loop.sock_accept`'s own
    internal future is already done the instant this loop's `await`
    reaches it -- awaiting an already-done future never suspends a task,
    so nothing but `_accept_loop`'s own `await asyncio.sleep(0)` lets the
    loop below step it more than once; without that yield this test hangs
    to `pyproject.toml`'s own per-test ceiling rather than reaching three
    attempts.
