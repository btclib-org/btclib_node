"""What this node answers a peer with, message by message.

`main.handle_p2p` turns a callback that raises into a disconnect, and
`handle_p2p_handshake` does the same, so what a callback does with a
message it dislikes is the difference between refusing the message and
losing the peer. The functional tests drive two cooperating nodes, which
is the path where every message is welcome; these are the rest.
