    Exercised at each of the six points `db.py` reads through
    `_raise_if_corrupted`: the open itself, the schema-version check's
    own read, `_has_any_data`'s own scan, `get`, `get_meta`, and
    `__iter__`. A genuine defect this guards against: swallowing an
    unrelated fault -- a disk-full `OSError`, a permission error --
    under the same classification as a checksummed corruption would
    hide it from whoever reads the log for the name that is supposed
    to be specific.
