"""A pruned node, over a real connection: what it serves and what it drops.

The unit tests (`block_db_test.py`, `p2p/callbacks_test.py`,
`download_test.py`, `main_test.py`) cover the mechanism --
`BlockDB.prune_up_to`'s own deletion, `main.prune_up_to_height`'s own
call into it, `_below_prune_threshold`'s own disconnect decision, and
`DownloadManager._reachable_blocks`'s own skip -- each against a double
standing in for the rest of the node. What this checks is the same four
things over an actual socket, between two real `Node`s: a pruned node's
own `version` on the wire, an old `getdata` answered by dropping the
connection rather than by a `notfound`, a recent one still answered in
full, and a real client's own `DownloadManager` never sending that old
`getdata` in the first place.
