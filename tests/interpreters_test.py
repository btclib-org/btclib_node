"""The interpreters this package claims are the ones it runs on.

One fact, and each of these declares it: `requires-python` is the floor,
`Programming Language :: Python :: X.Y` is what PyPI shows whoever is
choosing the package, `.python-version` is what a bare `uv run` picks,
and what CI names is what actually runs. Nothing compared them, and
they drift in the direction hardest to notice -- a classifier left
behind when a floor moves is a package advertising an interpreter its
suite never touches, and the person it misleads is not reading this
repository.

Section 1 of the organization standard is what they have to say between
them, and the window it asks for is python.org's release cycle rather
than this tree's choice. This module does not know that calendar and
does not try to: python.org keeps it, and a test hard-coding a date
would be one more thing to move. What it holds is the weaker and
checkable claim that whatever these say, they say the same thing.

The window here is one version wide, so every site naming an
interpreter names that one, which is why the comparison runs over every
workflow and composite action rather than over the platform sweeps
alone the way `btclib`'s copy of this module does. `test.yml`'s matrix
carries a second value, the free-threaded build of the same version,
which a classifier does not distinguish.

`pyproject.toml` is parsed, `tomllib` being in the standard library at
this tree's floor. The workflow files are yaml and no dependency group
here carries a parser for that, so they are read with the pattern
below -- which reads a comment naming an interpreter as readily as a
step that runs one, the safe direction to be wrong in: a comment
arguing for a version this tree no longer classifies has gone stale
too.

# passing on a gate it has not read; where the narrowing leaves the

# comments are dropped before the read above runs, where `_named` above
# keeps them on purpose. The two want opposite things: a stale comment
# naming a version this tree no longer classifies is worth catching,
# where this file's own header argues at length about `3.14t` and a
# comment is not a job that runs it.
#
# What this read does not answer shows in `dist`. A setup step naming
# no interpreter takes the one `.python-version` pins, so that job's
# own interpreter is nowhere in this workflow -- `_PIN` above is where
# the pin is read, and a free-threaded pin reaches it as `3.14t`. And a
# version a job names counts whatever that job does with it: `dist`'s
# own `--python` runs the sdist normalizer and the bill-of-materials
# writer under `--no-project`, which import nothing of this package.
#
# A step carrying an `if:` of its own is a narrower thing than either,
# because the job can conclude without it having run. Two shapes reach
# that same end and this read separates neither: a step keyed on a
# prior step's outcome is skipped when `continue-on-error: true`
# upstream lets that step fail without reddening the job, which is
# `free-threaded`'s own suite step, its sync failing on every run today
# (issue #723); and a step keyed on the run's own context is skipped
# whenever the context does not hold, which is `dist`'s call to
# `./.github/actions/dev-version`, gated `if: inputs.version-suffix
# != ''` and so run on a release rehearsal and on nothing else --
# neither a pull request nor a push to `main`, as `test.yml`'s own
# comment beside it says.
#
# So the rule is one rule: a conditioned step is not shown to have run,
# and what it names or reaches is not this read's business. `3.14t`
# named in `free-threaded`'s unconditioned setup step is refused for
# that reason (issue #750), and an interpreter reached only through
# `dist`'s rehearsal-only step is refused for the same one. Erring this
# way costs nothing that matters: an interpreter dropped is a claim of
# support this tree does not make, where an interpreter counted in is a
# claim that the gate exercises what it does not -- the "it passed
# somewhere" that section 3 of the organization standard refuses, and
# the whole reason issue #750 exists.
#
# Nor does this read stop at the workflow file: a `uses: ./...` an
# unconditioned step of a gating job calls is read too, the
# repository's own file and no network fetch, the same way `_CI` above
# reads every composite action. Issue #757 is what closes that gap.
# **No job the gate waits on is shaped that way today** -- the gate's
# only local-action call is the conditioned step above, and the tree's
# other one is `integration-bitcoind.yml`'s, which no gate job reaches
# -- so the follow is held by a unit test on job text of its own rather
# than by the real workflow, which is what a walk that currently finds
# nothing has to be. A `uses:` pinned to a third party's own commit is
# not read this way at all: fetching it would be the network call this
# test does not make, so an interpreter such an action hard-codes
# outside the inputs its caller passes stays outside this read's reach.

    an interpreter` assertion fires only where the aggregate's own
    `needs:` is the unread one (btclib-org/.github#1031). No workflow
    here writes a block list today, so this is job text of its own
    rather than the real gate, which is what a walk that currently
    finds nothing has to be.

    A whole-line comment among the items, a blank line between two of
    them and a trailing comment on one each end a run of adjacent item
    lines, and a yaml parser reads each of them as the same two items
    (btclib-org/.github#1038). None of the forms below is invented:
    `_jobs` leaves a whole-line comment as a run of spaces one short of
    the indent it was written at, and a trailing comment written with
    two spaces before the `#` as a single space, where a copy of this
    module that keeps comments hands the same pattern the `#` itself --
    so both forms stand below, each spelled out rather than one reached
    from the other.

    The job dict is flat, so every case asserts the closure its own
    text earns: the aggregate and the one job a scalar names, where a
    list of either shape reaches both. A dict in which `changes`
    waited on `coverage` buys comparable expectations with a second
    route to `coverage`, and an item dropped below a residue is
    reached by that route anyway: the rows a whole-line comment and a
    blank line are written for then hold under a reader carrying no
    whole-line alternative at all (btclib-org/.github#1053). What the
    chain was also pinning, and what nothing else in the module
    pins, is that `_needed` walks: flat, one hop is the whole
    closure, so a reader taking a job's direct `needs:` and
    stopping answers every row here and the real gate alike. One
    chained dict stands below the flat rows for that alone,
    asserting its own closure and nothing about a shape.
