    `run`'s own teardown -- `peer_db.close()`, `chainstate.close()`,

    -- only runs once a node's thread has reached the end of its loop,
    which a node built here and driven on the thread that built it
    never does, so each is closed explicitly here instead. The two
    loops and `logger.close()`'s own file close for the reason
    `tests/unit/init_test.py`'s `a_networked_node` is already the
    precedent for the loops: a dropped event loop or open file is a
    `ResourceWarning` raised against whichever test the collector is
    running when it reaches it, not against this one. The managers'
    own `stop()` is not called -- it waits on a thread that `start()`
    never began.

    The three stores close for a different reason. The store is
    RocksDB through `rocksdict` (btclib-org/btclib-node#641), and a
    dropped `Rdict` raises no `ResourceWarning` at all -- measured
    directly, where dropping this function's own event loop or open
    file does. What a live handle holds instead is `db.py`'s own
    directory `LOCK` ("The lock stays" section): a second `Rdict`
    opened on the same path while the first is still referenced fails
    outright with an IO error naming the lock, measured directly,
    never merely a warning. `regtest_node` hands out several nodes
    sharing one `tmp_path`, and the node holding a store's handle
    stays referenced by the test for as long as the test holds it --
    nothing here drops that reference on its own -- so a test that
    reopens the same store needs this `close()` to have actually run,
    not a collector that may never reach the handle in time.

    The worker pool is taken down here too, rather than left to
    `Node.__del__`'s own backstop: that backstop only runs once the
    collector reaches this node, and where the pool it built is also
    unreachable by then, `gc.collect()` does not promise which of the
    two finalizers -- the node's or the pool's own -- runs first, so
    relying on it is a `ResourceWarning` that fires on some collection
    passes and not others.
