"""Every `pragma: no cover` gives its reason on the same line.

`pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.coverage.report]` states the rule and points
its check at section 8 of the organization standard rather than
restating it, so that the two move together:
`git grep -nE 'pragma: no cover$' -- '*.py'` is what section 8 names,
and what this module runs, unchanged -- a site giving no reason, a
reason on the line above being out of its reach.

This sits at `tests/` root rather than under `tests/unit/`, on the same
ground as `interpreters_test.py`: the rule comes from `pyproject.toml`,
a file neither `src/btclib_node/` nor `tests/` owns, and the command
above reads every tracked `.py` file the same way regardless of which
of those two -- or of `.github/scripts/` or `fuzz/` -- it sits under,
so there is no module of `src/btclib_node/` this is a test *of*, and no
suite machinery it reads the way `unit/coverage_floor_test.py` reads
`conftest.py` or `unit/helpers_test.py` reads `tests/__init__.py`. The
rule is section 8's own rather than one of section 7's conventions
`unit/conventions_test.py`'s `_CONVENTIONS` transcribes, so it earns no
row in `tests/README.md`'s *Convention tests* table either.
