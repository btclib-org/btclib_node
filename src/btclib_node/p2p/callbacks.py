"""One handler per p2p message type, and the two tables that dispatch to them.

`callbacks` is read by `p2p.main.handle_p2p` for a connection past its
handshake; `handshake_callbacks` is read by `p2p.main.handle_p2p_handshake`
for a connection still completing one. Every handler shares the same
signature, `(node, msg, conn)`, whether or not its own body reads every
argument -- the dispatch table calls each one uniformly, and an unread
`msg` or `conn` documents that rather than a mistake.

`advance_getdata` and `advance_cfilters` are the two exceptions to "one
handler, one message": `getdata` and `get_cfilters` below, and
`p2p.main.resume_getdata` and `resume_cfilters`, each call one of them to
pace an answer against the connection's own send queue, across however
many turns of `Node`'s own loop that answer takes to drain.

    complexity check counts branches against, and every `if` moved into
    a helper is one fewer counted there, whichever helper it lands in.
    Neither of the two questions here reads or writes anything the loop
    itself needs to -- both are pure functions of the three numbers a
    caller already has to hand. "Flush" wins over "pause" where both
    would otherwise apply: sending what is already owed, even while

    a difference in what a full send buffer does.** Core's
    `ProcessGetData` (`src/net_processing.cpp`,
    at bitcoin/bitcoin@05e49b342f) checks `pfrom.fPauseSend` before every
    item, hit or miss, but a miss only does `vNotFound.push_back` and
    `fPauseSend` is driven by `m_send_memusage` -- bytes already handed
    to the transport -- so a request answered entirely in misses costs
    that signal nothing, and the `notfound` at the end of the loop is
    pushed unconditionally. Core can afford that: `nSendBufferMaxSize`
    is only ever read to set `fPauseSend`, which makes the node stop
    *reading* from that peer, and nothing anywhere disconnects on send
    volume. This tree's `MAX_QUEUED_SEND_BYTES`
    (`p2p/connection.py`) does disconnect, so the same unbounded batch
    that merely pauses Core drops an honest peer here

    Shared by `getdata` below, dispatching a request for the first time,
    and by `p2p.main.resume_getdata`, retrying one already paused -- each
    pops what it serves off the front of the same `deque`, the shape
    `advance_cfilters` below already gives `get_cfilters`.

    A transaction is served from the mempool only if the peer wants it
    relayed, answered `notfound` on a miss; a requested block not held
    is silent. Both match Core -- BIP37's `fRelay` is written about
    announcements, "broadcast transactions will not be announced", and
    says nothing about a transaction a peer asks for by hash, but Core
    answers nothing anyway: with `fRelay` false and `NODE_BLOOM` not
    offered, `ProcessGetData` skips every transaction item outright, and
    where `NODE_BLOOM` is offered, `FindTxForGetData` gates on
    `m_last_inv_sequence`, which never advances for a peer nothing is
    announced to. This node follows Core rather than the sentence, and
    the reason is what the sentence does not cover: serving the mempool
    by hash to a peer that declined announcements answers, for anyone
    willing to ask, whether a given transaction reached this node -- and
    a peer that declined is the one with no other reason to be asking.
    Blocks are not affected: a peer that wants no transactions is still
    a peer syncing the chain. A block this node does not hold gets no
    `notfound` either: `ProcessGetBlockData` returns on one with no
    `notfound` of its own, `vNotFound` being `ProcessGetData`'s own local
    and never touched by the function it calls out to for a block item.
    `_below_prune_threshold`'s own docstring is where a pruned node's
    other answer to a block item -- disconnecting rather than staying
    silent -- is argued against the same function.

    `conn.queued_send_bytes` is read the same way `advance_cfilters`
    below reads it, and holds what `conn.send` has counted -- this
    loop's own previous items among them, since it counts on this
    thread before scheduling anything on `P2pManager`'s. A check
    reading only what that loop had got round to writing would see none
    of them and serve the whole request as fast as it can pop it, past
    `MAX_QUEUED_SEND_BYTES` and into the drop, for a peer asking for
    the blocks this node asks its own peers for
    (btclib-org/btclib-node#512).

    What the read can miss is either half of a count it did not make. A
    drain is the loop's -- `conn.send` counts on this thread, but the
    decrement once the write completes is not -- and that direction is
    the safe one, an unseen decrement making the number too large and
    this pause sooner. An increment can also be missed, and that one is
    not: `P2pManager`'s thread reaches `_queue` too, through
    `_prune_stale_connections`'s `send_ping`, so a read here can predate
    a ping and pause later rather than sooner. What makes that
    immaterial is the magnitude rather than the direction: one ping is a
    bare envelope and a nonce, where what `MAX_QUEUED_SEND_BYTES` leaves
    above this loop's own bound is a whole block message and the room
    over it (`connection.py`) -- so the read needs no lock, and a torn
    one is not a risk to guard against either (CPython never hands back
    a value that was not, at some point, actually written).

    `notfound` batches whatever this call found missing, sent once this
    call is done serving -- whether `items` ran out or this paused --
    rather than once for the whole original request: Core's own
    `vNotFound` is a per-call local too, built and sent fresh by every
    `ProcessGetData` call rather than carried across them.

    **A miss is paced too, against the same bound, though nothing is
    sent for one the moment it is found.** `not_found_bytes` is this
    call's own running total of what a `notfound` batching every miss
    collected so far would cost -- `_NOTFOUND_ITEM_BYTES` per entry,
    counted the instant a miss joins `not_found` rather than once the
    batch is finally sent. Read together with `conn.queued_send_bytes`
    at the top of the loop, it is what makes a run of misses pause the
    same way a run of blocks already does, rather than accumulating
    for free and landing in one send with no pacing check in front of
    it (btclib-org/btclib-node#529): before this, nothing charged a
    miss anything, so `conn.queued_send_bytes` could still read zero
    after fifty thousand of them, and the loop had no reason to stop
    before popping every item this request named.

    A batch is also flushed -- sent and reset, without pausing the
    call -- once it reaches `MAX_INV_SZ` on its own, whatever
    `conn.queued_send_bytes` reads: `NotFound.assert_valid` refuses
    more entries than that, and `node.pending_getdata` can hand this
    function a backlog of `MAX_PENDING_GETDATA_ITEMS` (`getdata` below),
    twice `MAX_INV_SZ`, drawn from two stacked requests rather than the
    one this bound was sized against. All of that many being misses is
    an entirely mundane way to reach it -- every hash in both requests
    having left the mempool between the first `getdata` and the second
    is enough -- and at `_NOTFOUND_ITEM_BYTES` apiece the byte bound
    above alone would let it happen: the whole backlog's own worth of
    misses is still short of `MAX_GETDATA_INFLIGHT_BYTES`. Chunking on
    the item count this class already enforces is what keeps that
    backlog from reaching `NotFound`'s own constructor as one batch

    connection has not yet finished serving.

    A second `getdata` arriving while `conn`'s own entry on

    rather than replacing it, up to `MAX_PENDING_GETDATA_ITEMS` -- past

    `get_cfilters` below already gives a request past its own
    `MAX_PENDING_CFILTERS_HEIGHTS`, and for the same reason: dropping
    the connection over pipelining this node already tolerates
    elsewhere would be disproportionate to what tripped it, and
    `MAX_QUEUED_SEND_BYTES` (`connection.py`) is still underneath this
    to catch a peer that is actually abusive.

    Core's own protection here is not a numeric cap either, whatever
    reading only `Peer.m_getdata_requests` (appended to at

    (`net_processing.cpp:5429-5436`, at bitcoin/bitcoin@b91d983f66) is

    prevents m_getdata_requests to grow unbounded", by returning before
    `PollMessage` -- the call that reads this connection's own next
    message off the wire -- whenever `m_getdata_requests` is still
    non-empty, and again whenever `fPauseSend` is set. Core therefore
    never backlogs more than one request's own `MAX_INV_SZ` items per
    connection: it simply stops reading that connection's next message,
    `getdata` included, until the current one has drained.

    That discipline does not port here without a larger redesign:
    `P2pManager.messages` (`p2p/manager.py`) is one `deque` shared by
    every connection, and `handle_p2p` (`p2p/main.py`) pops one message
    off its front regardless of which connection sent it, where Core's
    own `m_getdata_requests` and `PollMessage` are both per connection
    to begin with -- there is no single connection this node could
    "stop reading from" without reordering that shared queue or giving
    each connection a backlog of its own. `MAX_PENDING_GETDATA_ITEMS`
