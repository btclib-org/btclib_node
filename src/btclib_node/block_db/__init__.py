"""`BlockDB`: blocks and their undo data on disk.

Blocks and reverse patches (`RevBlock`) are appended to flat, rotating
files under `data_dir`; `BlockLocation` and `FileMetadata`, kept in the
key-value store, are what let a later read seek straight to a block
instead of scanning a file for it. A reverse patch is filed against its
own block only once that block's branch connects, `pending_rev_blocks`
holding one generated for a branch `update_chain` may still refuse.

`prune_up_to` is this store's own half of pruning
(btclib-org/btclib-node#601): it deletes a block and its reverse patch,
by height rather than by file, because this store's own rotation
(`__find_block_file`) tracks append order and not a file's own height
range the way Core's `FlatFilePos`/`nHeightFirst`/`nHeightLast`
(`node/blockstorage.h`, at bitcoin/bitcoin@ca7162cde5) does. `live` is
what lets a `.blk`/`.rev` file still be reclaimed once every block it
ever held has been pruned this way -- `_release`'s own docstring is
where that is argued end to end, the uncomfortable half (a syncing
node's own append order tracking height only approximately) included.

    that class carries no `parse` and no `serialize` on purpose (its own
    docstring, and btclib-org/btclib#1123), on-disk shape being a node's
    own decision. `parse` and `serialize` below are that decision: a
    varint packing `(height << 1) | coinbase`, ahead of the output
    itself, matching Core's own `Coin` (`src/coins.h`, at
    bitcoin/bitcoin@204256c73f) except for one thing -- Core additionally
    runs the output through `TxOutCompression`, a space optimisation not
    reproduced here, so the two do not agree byte for byte and are not
    meant to. `KeyValueStore`'s own store is measured write-dominated
    rather than read-dominated -- a modern block's own reads costing on
    the order of 3us each against 17us for a delete or a put at eight
    million rows (btclib-org/btclib-node#586) -- which argues for a
    varint kept as tight as `var_int` already makes it, not for folding
    in a second space optimisation on top of it.

    `UtxoIndex.add_block` sets `height` and `is_coinbase` when an output
    is first created; `UtxoIndex.apply_rev_block` restores a `Coin`
    exactly as `add_block` staged it for removal, so a coin a reorg
    brings back carries the height and the coinbase bit it was created
    with, never the height of the block being disconnected or of the one
    reconnecting it.

        Core's own `UnlinkPrunedFiles` (`node/blockstorage.cpp`, at

        `FindFilesToPrune` sees inside it is behind the retained depth,
        found by the file's own stored height range
        (`nHeightFirst`/`nHeightLast`). This store's own rotation
        (`__find_block_file`) tracks append order rather than height, so
        `prune_up_to` above reaches the same file from the other
        direction -- one block at a time, oldest height first -- and this
        is where the count converges on Core's own "every block in this
        file is gone" the same file-granularity deletion answers to. A
        syncing node writes in close to height order already, so the two
        line up in the ordinary case; a node whose forks left blocks
        scattered across files out of height order reclaims those files
        later than Core would, once the last of their still-live blocks
        is finally pruned too, rather than not at all.

        Never unlinks the file `file_index` currently names: that is
        still open for new blocks or patches to land in, whatever this
        call's own count says, and reclaiming it here would have the very
        next `add_block` or `finalize` reopen a file this store had just
        deleted out from under itself.

        `filename` is trusted to already be a key of `self.files`, the
        same way `__find_block_file`'s own `self.files[filename].size`
        is above -- every `BlockLocation`/`RevBlock` location this class
        ever hands `_delete_block`/`_delete_rev_block` came from a
        `self.blocks`/`self.rev_patches` entry that was itself only ever
        set alongside the matching `self.files` entry, in `add_block` and
        `finalize`, so there is no path that reaches here with one and
        not the other.

        Only ever closes `open_rev_file`, never `open_block_file`, and
        that asymmetry is real rather than a gap: `__get_block_file`
        keeps `open_block_file` in lockstep with `self.file_index` on
        every `add_block`, the very call that would have to move
        `self.file_index` past a `.blk` file for that file to reach this
        method at all, so a `.blk` file past the guard above never has
        `open_block_file` still pointing at it -- there is no `filename`
        for which that check could ever be true. `__find_rev_file` opens
        a `.rev` file named for its own block's own file index
        (`btclib-org/btclib-node#116`), not for whatever is current, so
        `open_rev_file` alone can lag `self.file_index` this way.
