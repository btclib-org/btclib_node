# Contributing

What this repository holds in common with the others of the organization
— the toolchain, the lint gate, the tool tables behind it, the workflow
set and the branch rules — is stated once in the
[btclib-org repository standard](https://github.com/btclib-org/.github),
each rule with the alternative it was decided against. It binds this
repository, so a change departing from it is a divergence, and one filed
as an issue in that repository rather than here: a difference between two
repositories belongs to neither of them.

**This file is the same in every repository of the organization up to
its last section.** What is true of one tree only — the commands that
build its environment, the gates it runs, which of its workflows decide
a merge — is under that heading, and the comparison stops there.

## The issue tracker

Where an issue is filed, and what an alignment finding has to name, is
[the standard's *What this repository is*][s-what]: an issue spanning
repositories, or whose subject is the standard, goes to
[btclib-org/.github](https://github.com/btclib-org/.github/issues), and
one about this tree alone stays here.

A finding noticed while doing something else is filed, not carried.
`REVIEWING.md`'s *Every collateral finding becomes an issue* is the whole
of what to do with one, and it applies to an author as much as to a
reviewer: a pull request answering two questions cannot be accepted for
either.

## Documentation and comments

[Section 9 of the standard][s9] is the prose style, and it governs the
prose this tree ships — comments, docstrings and markdown. It is not
restated here: a second wording is the one that goes stale, which is
that section's own *One fact in one place*.

A commit message is prose this tree ships too, though section 9 does not
say so: [the only merge method the rule accepts][s11] puts it on `main`
as the landing commit's body, so what is written in one is read there
long after the branch is gone.

## Pull requests

What `main` accepts, and what it refuses to everyone, is [section 11 of
the standard][s11]. Run the gates locally before opening anything —
the last section of this file says which they are — because CI runs
exactly them, so a red run there is a local run that was not done.

What a pull request's title and description have to say about the issues
it closes, and why a manual link in the Development panel is a trap
neither of them shows, is [the standard's *What a pull request says it
is*][s-title]. Read it before opening one; it is the rule most often
found broken after the fact.

**Before it is opened, the branch's own commit subjects and bodies are
read against that same rule.** The description does not exist yet to
disagree with them, and [the standard][s-title] has the command that
scans the branch's own commit text for a verb in front of a reference.

**The two spellings are named here as well as there, against [section 9's
*One fact in one place*][s9]**, the paragraph above naming the section
and not the forms, which are the half a citation is got wrong in:
`(closes #N)` cites an issue the change closes, wherever the citation
sits — the title, the commit subject where [*Merge method*][s11] makes
that the thing that lands, and a `CHANGELOG.md` entry — and `(issue #N)`
cites, in those same places, an issue the change advances and does *not*
close. One token holds one meaning whichever file it sits in, so the
pair is chosen by what is true of the change rather than by which file
is being written, and a tree's own landed subjects are not what to copy
it from: nothing already landed is rewritten, so what a repository wrote
before the rule stays where it is.

`REVIEWING.md` is the standard a review is written against, and is this
file's other half. Read before opening a pull request, it is what the
pull request will be answered against.

`CHANGELOG.md` gets an entry for anything a reader would notice, and the
release notes move only for something a user has to *act* on, in the
repositories that publish.

### One subject, opened as soon as it is written

A pull request answers one question. Issues that share a subject are one
pull request, closing each of them; issues that do not are one pull
request each, however small either of them is.

It is opened the moment it is written and verified — not held for the
previous one to be reviewed or to land, and not batched with the next. A
batch arrives as one reviewing job with several subjects, which is the
shape that costs the most to read; a finished pull request held back is
review that could have started and did not.

Working this way stacks branches, which is fine and costs one rule: a
child whose base was amended is moved with the old base named,

```shell
git rebase --onto <new-base> <old-base-sha> <child>
```

because a plain rebase replays the base's old commit inside the child,
and the forge then shows the base's old text as additions with nothing
red anywhere. Read the child's diff afterwards rather than trusting the
rebase, and retarget each child onto `main` as its parent lands.

### The landing queue

Where more than one pull request is open against this repository, only
one is carried to `main` at a time: rebased onto the tip, reviewed on
that head, and landed, while every other one waits, untouched, for its
turn. This governs which of several *already open* pull requests reaches
`main` next; *One subject, opened as soon as it is written* above governs
the moment before that, when a finished one is opened — the two do not
conflict, since a pull request is still opened without delay and still
waits its turn once several are open.

The reason is CI throughput, not the ack a waiting pull request keeps —
`REVIEWING.md`'s *The verdict* states what an ack belongs to, and
*Landing it* below states which rebase voids one. Every rebase queues
this repository's whole check matrix against the organization's ceiling
on concurrent jobs, so rebasing every waiting pull request after each
landing spends that capacity on runs the next landing invalidates
anyway, and delays the one pull request that is actually next: work
spent on a pull request that is not next is work that delays the one
that is. The ceiling's figure is `REPOSITORY.md`'s, under *Plan-gated
settings*, beside the command that re-derives it.

Order is cheapest and least contended first, most invasive last, so that
a large change does not sit at the head blocking everything behind it.

The maintainer may declare a bounded exception — several pull requests in
flight against one repository, for a named piece of work — trading the
cost above for throughput; it is recorded as a comment in
[btclib-org/.github](https://github.com/btclib-org/.github/issues), by
*The issue tracker* above, and holds only for the work it names.

### The review

A review is given promptly and on local evidence. It does not wait for
CI, does not report a check as a finding, and does not discuss a run at
all: whether CI is green is the author's business, once, at landing time.

The exchange is anchored to a sha rather than to a branch, a branch being
free to move under a review:

- the author hands off by naming the sha pushed and the evidence run
  against it, then leaves that head alone;
- the reviewer answers with findings — where, what is wrong, how they
  know it, and whether each is blocking;
- the author accepts what is reasonable, declines the rest with a reason
  in the thread, and pushes the answer without waiting for CI;
- the reviewer resolves the threads they opened, that being what says a
  finding is closed, and re-reviews the delta rather than the branch.

**What ends the loop is the ack of record**, and the author does not
supply their own. A reading that says what it found and delivers no
verdict is a review too and ends nothing; [the standard's *Review*][s-rev]
has which is which, and `REVIEWING.md` has how each is written. A
disagreement that survives a second exchange goes to the maintainer
instead of into a third round.

### Landing it

CI is read once, and this is where. Rebase onto `main`'s tip, push that
head so the checks run on the tree that will land, and only then wait for
them: checks read before a rebase describe a tree nobody is landing. A
rebase that moved nothing but the base leaves the ack standing; one that
resolved a conflict does not, that resolution being a change no reviewer
has seen.

Then squash, [the only method the rule accepts][s11].

**The maintainer's bypass is not automatic — it has to be invoked, and
`gh pr merge` cannot invoke it**, refusing client-side before it asks
GitHub anything:

```text
Pull request is not mergeable: the base branch policy prohibits the merge
```

The merge endpoint applies it server-side, and it is the same endpoint
the merge button asks:

```shell
gh api -X PUT repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<n>/merge \
  -f merge_method=squash -f sha=<the head the checks ran on>
```

**The `sha` is not optional.** Reading the ack and merging are two
calls, and the head is free to move between them — the push that would
move it comes out of the same round the verdict does. Unpinned, the
command takes whatever sits at the head when it runs; pinned, [the
endpoint answers `409` where the head has moved][gh-merge], and a round
lost that way is cheaper than a tree nobody has read reaching `main`.
*The review* above anchors the exchange to a sha and [section 11][s11]
has an ack name one: the pin is that rule reaching the call that
performs the landing.

**Verify what landed rather than trusting the answer**, the signature
[the standard asks for][s-sigs] being a valid one rather than a
particular signer's:

```shell
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/main \
  --jq '.commit.verification | {verified, reason}'
```

**What it closed is read again here too, from the landed sha rather
than from the pull request**: [the standard's *What a pull request says
it is*][s-title] has the second read, and why the first alone does not
reach a squash subject composed after it runs.

The forge deletes the head branch itself, per the setting section 11
names. What is still yours is bringing every checkout sitting on `main`
up to date,
that being where the next session starts from and a stale one being where
a branch gets built on a base that has moved. `REPOSITORY.md` carries the
settings and why they are what they are.

## This repository in particular

Everything above is the same file in every repository of the
organization; everything below is this one's, and the comparison stops at
this heading.

### The environment and the gates

uv is the only thing that has to be installed; it fetches the interpreter
`.python-version` pins and every dependency group itself. There is a
project here and it is installed, so the gates run through `uv run` and
not through the `uvx` a tree with no project needs:

```shell
uv sync
uv run pytest
git add -A && uv run pre-commit run --all-files
uv run pre-commit validate-config .pre-commit-config.yaml
uv run --locked --no-default-groups --group docs \
    sphinx-build -W -n -b html docs/source docs/build/html
if grep -rn 'href="#\./' docs/build/html --include='*.html'; then
  echo "::error::the links above resolve to no page (unresolved relative path)"
  exit 1
fi
```

`--all-files` means every file git tracks, so a file that is new and not
yet staged is not one of them: run it unstaged and the hooks pass over
exactly the files most likely to fail them. Staging first is what makes
the local gate answer the same question pre-commit.ci does.

The documentation build is the one no hook reads reStructuredText for: a
docstring docutils cannot parse fails it with every hook green -- a name
ending in an underscore is a reference to a link target, which is what
the double backticks around a literal like ``NODE_`` are for.

**Not `--only-group docs` in place of the documentation build's own
`--no-default-groups --group docs`.** The two read like the same request
and are not: `--only-group` excludes the project along with every other
group, so autodoc's own import of `btclib_node` raises
`ModuleNotFoundError` under `-W` on a `.venv` that does not already have
it installed. Where the same `.venv` was synced earlier in the session
by `uv sync` or `uv run pytest`, the project is already there and the
build succeeds without `--only-group` ever having installed it, so the
command's outcome tracks the `.venv`'s own history rather than the tree
it is meant to check. `docs.yml` runs the form above for the same
reason, next to the same warning.

The `grep` after the build is that gate's second step. What myst renders
for a target it cannot resolve is an anchor on the page it is already on
-- an id nothing defines -- and the build fails on it only through the
`myst.xref_missing` warning `docs/source/conf.py` suppresses nowhere,
having resolved every link the included root files carry ahead of myst's
own resolver; the grep asks the same question of the HTML, where a
suppression cannot hide the answer. One spelling answers for every local
destination, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`'s `local-link-prefix` hook holding
each of them to the `./` prefix.

`validate-config` is worth running before pushing a change to the hook
config: it catches what a wrong `types_or` tag or a malformed entry would
otherwise turn into a red lint job.

**Check exit codes, not filtered output.** `pre-commit run ... | grep -v
Passed` hides a failure, and `grep` finding nothing exits 1, which is not
the gate's answer to anything.

**The gate is not installed as a git hook.** `pre-commit install` writes
into the common git directory, which every worktree of this repository
shares: `git -C <worktree> rev-parse --git-path hooks` answers with the
same directory in each. So one session installing it installs it for
every other. Run the gate by hand before committing.

Every statement and every branch is covered, and `uv run pytest` fails if
any stops being. A run narrowed by a path, `-k`, `-m`, `--deselect`,
`--ignore`, `--ignore-glob` or `--last-failed` is not the run a floor
over the whole suite is a claim about, so it is not held to one —
`tests/conftest.py` is where that is decided, and where anything else
narrowing a run is added. `--cov-fail-under` asked for explicitly still
applies.

Every test is bounded, too. A node that stops answering fails the test
that built it, named, with a stack of every thread it left running,
instead of holding the run open until something outside it gives up. The
limit is `timeout` in `pyproject.toml`, measured against the slowest test
there is and reasoned about where it is set.

### What gates a merge, and what only reports

`lint.yml` runs the hooks `.pre-commit-config.yaml` declares, so there
is no second list of tools and versions to keep in step; its invocation
differs from the one above only in being `--locked` and in printing what
a fixing hook would have written. `test.yml` runs the suite over the
interpreter and platform axes its own header argues, held to the
coverage floor `pyproject.toml` declares on its `ubuntu-latest` cells.
A pull request that touches
only the root prose skips the suite and reports the skip as a pass, which
is what keeps an aggregate check from blocking on a run that never
happened. `docs.yml` runs the same build the environment section above
does, on every pull request the way `lint.yml` and `test.yml` do rather
than on a schedule, and is a required check alongside them.
`integration-bitcoind.yml` starts a real `bitcoind` and asks it what no
recorded reply under `tests/_data` can answer, and is required too:
`REPOSITORY.md`'s *Required checks on main* names them all.

**Whether any of these can refuse a merge is a repository setting and
not a file**, and `REPOSITORY.md` reads it back from the endpoint rather
than restating it here. Read that file before assuming a red run stops
anything.

Everything else reports. `codeql.yml` follows a value from a peer's
message or an RPC request body to where it is used, which no hook here
does. `os-macos.yml` runs the suite on the one platform
`pyproject.toml` classifies that the gate does not run, and its header
says what differs beneath it. `os-ubuntu.yml` runs it on
`ubuntu-24.04-arm` beside the gate's own image, which is where aarch64
Linux is exercised at all. `links.yml` asks whether somebody else's
server answered, and
`bootstrap-dns.yml` asks the same question of the DNS seeds
`src/btclib_node/chains.py` names. `claude-review.yml` writes the review
and its own header says it must not become a required check.
`vendored-vectors.yml` re-checks `tests/_data/README.md`'s pin against
upstream, `deps-latest.yml` upgrades every dependency and runs the suite,
the lint gate and the packaging checks against the result,
`deps-oldest.yml` is that sentinel's mirror and takes the registry
specifiers down to their oldest allowed release instead, its own header
saying which declared floor that leaves out and why, `pypi-install.yml`
installs `btclib-node` from the index rather than from a checkout and
runs it past import, and
`mutation.yml` is its own section below. `fuzz.yml` runs the atheris harnesses
under `fuzz/` against octets nobody chose, and its own header says which
parser this tree owns of what a peer reaches and why the harness is a script
rather than the ClusterFuzzLite container the sibling libraries build.
`scorecard.yml` runs OpenSSF's third-party audit of the repository's
supply-chain posture, on push to `main` and on a weekly schedule. Unlike
every other workflow above, it carries neither a `pull_request` trigger
nor `workflow_dispatch`, so there is no way to ask about a branch at
all -- its own header says why.

Which day each of the periodic ones runs is one calendar for the whole
organization, in [section 10 of `btclib-org/.github`'s
README](https://github.com/btclib-org/.github/blob/main/README.md), not
repeated here. The trade it makes is worth knowing before relying on it:
a defect only a sweep can see sits on `main` until that sweep runs, at
most a week.

### Mutation testing

`mutation.yml` asks the question coverage cannot: a line the suite
executes is not a line the suite checks. It gates nothing and runs
weekly; the configuration is the single source of the scope and the
test command.

```shell
uv run --locked --no-default-groups --group test --group mutation \
    cosmic-ray baseline .github/mutation/interpreter.toml
uv run --locked --no-default-groups --group test --group mutation \
    cosmic-ray init .github/mutation/interpreter.toml interpreter.sqlite
uv run --locked --no-default-groups --group test --group mutation \
    cosmic-ray exec .github/mutation/interpreter.toml interpreter.sqlite
uv run --locked --no-default-groups --group test --group mutation \
    cr-report --surviving-only --show-diff interpreter.sqlite
```

The session writes each mutation into `src/btclib_node/interpreter.py`
and restores it afterwards, so nothing else may read the file while it
runs. `interpreter.py` is the one scope so far — the consensus entry
point CLAUDE.md's architecture section names as what validates — and a
second scope is a second `.toml` beside it, the way
`btclib-org/btclib`'s own `.github/mutation/` holds one per profile.

`test-command` in `.github/mutation/interpreter.toml` runs with `-n0`,
overriding `addopts`' own `-n auto` for the one process that reads the
mutated file: the file-edit form is the one CLAUDE.md's *Non-obvious
facts* names as reaching a worker, and cosmic-ray's own mutation is the
same form, applied to the file rather than to a running process.

### Building the distribution and checking it

`test.yml`'s `dist` job builds the sdist and the wheel and reads them
with the `check` dependency group, and `release.yml`'s publish jobs
download what that job built rather than building again. Running the
same commands here answers before a pull request does.

```shell
export SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=$(git log -1 --pretty=%ct)
uv build
uv run --no-project --python 3.14 .github/scripts/normalize_sdist.py dist/
uv run --locked --only-group check twine check --strict dist/*
uv run --locked --only-group check check-wheel-contents dist/*.whl
uv run --locked --only-group check pyroma --min 10 dist/*.tar.gz
```

The epoch and the normalizer come first because they rewrite the sdist's
member metadata, so what the three checks read is the archive that job
would hand on. `--only-group` is right here where it is wrong for the
documentation build above: these three read `dist/` and none of them
needs `btclib_node` installed.

`check-sdist` is not among them: `.pre-commit-config.yaml` runs it as a
hook, so the lint gate already asks it, and it builds an archive of its
own rather than reading the one above. `dist/` is ignored, so building
here does not dirty the tree that gate reads.

### A release path, and what it has published

`.github/workflows/release.yml` exists and section 2 of
[btclib-org/.github's
README](https://github.com/btclib-org/.github/blob/main/README.md)
measures a repository's tier from that file and `pyproject.toml` alone,
so this tree is tier 1 — the decision
[ISS btclib-org/btclib-node#286](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-node/issues/286)
records, superseding the tier-2 state
[PR btclib-org/btclib-node#171](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-node/pull/171)
had landed one day before that issue was filed. `RELEASING.md` and
`RELEASE_NOTES.md` are the two files section 2 gives a tier-1 repository
that #171 had removed, back under this section's own heading.

It has published once. `v2026.8.27` is on PyPI, the `pypi` and
`testpypi` pair of `RELEASING.md`'s *One-time setup* is what uploaded
it — `REPOSITORY.md`'s *The two publishing environments* reads that pair
back — and `project.version` is `2026.9`, the shape `RELEASING.md`'s
calendar scheme takes between releases: the month a cycle is open on,
with no day, which is what `version-check` refuses on a tag.

```shell
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://pypi.org/pypi/btclib-node/json
# 200
gh api repos/btclib-org/btclib-node/tags --jq '.[].name'
# v2026.8.27
```

**`v2026.8.27` is the one tag.** What this section used to say — that
the one tag was a lightweight `v0.1.0` from 2023, with a release page
and no artifact on it — was true until 2026-08-23, when that tag and
its release were deleted on the maintainer's decision closing
btclib-org/.github#105: a ref with no object of its own has nothing on
it to sign, and a repository that published nothing had no release the
tag was the record of. This section went on describing it for four days
afterwards (btclib-org/btclib-node#553), which is what a deletion
decided in another repository's issue costs when nobody carries it into
the files that mention it. `CHANGELOG.md` starts where the record
starts rather than where a tag does, for the reason its own
introduction gives.

Cutting a tag is signed and not by convention: the `tag-integrity`
ruleset requires a signature on `refs/tags/v*` and has no bypass actor,
so a tag made without `-s` is refused at the push rather than noticed
afterwards. `REPOSITORY.md` carries the call that reads that rule back,
and that rule is the whole of what `tag-integrity` holds —
`required_signatures`, and neither `non_fast_forward` nor `deletion` —
so a tag here can still be deleted and cut again *while nothing has
been published from it*: an index refuses a version that has been
uploaded once, whatever a tag does. **`v2026.8.27` is past that line
and `v2026.9.*` is not yet at it**, which is the distinction to hold
on to: deleting the tag of a published version leaves the version on
PyPI and takes away the only thing that says which commit it was built
from.

`RELEASING.md` is the whole of the procedure, from the one-time
publisher registration through the tag command itself — naming the
release commit explicitly, which the argumentless `git tag -s v<version>`
this paragraph could show instead does not — through what to do if a
release goes wrong; it is not repeated here.
